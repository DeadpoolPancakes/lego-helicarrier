# lego-helicarrier

### About

The idea of this came about after seeing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xUzXZFYYL8&t=3s) arduino for lego trains. After seeing this and ordering a handful of parts i made the decision to add some lights to the helicarrier i had on display.

The set was already setup for power functions and a manual crank to turn the rotors but no lights in them :(.

I set out to change this, i spent a bit of time prototyping with various iterations of how i would like the lights to sit. I eventually found a few holes in the structure of the model that would allow me to feed the led's and wires through and then slot them in to holes just below the fan blades.
